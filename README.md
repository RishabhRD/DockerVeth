# DockerVeth
Get veth pair name from container-name / container-id

# Why this script
I have observed that for any developer working on cloud, SDN, virtualisation
, etc with docker platform they face a problem of identifying veth pair name 
of containers. 
There are many answers on stackoverflow for it but not clear.
This task requires a complicated string manipulation. This script does it for you.
You can get the veth-pair name from container-name using this script.

# Installation Steps
This is a single script. If you want to use it you can use it directly or can 
extract it in system scope using install.sh so you can use it system-wide
